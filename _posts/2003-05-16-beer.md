I like beer cause it is good
I drink beer because I should
If there was a song to sing
I sing it and beer you bring

I drink beer when I am sad
Cause the beer, it makes me glad
Now there's nothing left to say
So let's go drink beer

Beer is good
Beer is good
Beer is good
And stuff
Beer is good
Beer is good
Beer is good
(Let's go drink some) Beer (beer!)
Beer (Beer!)
Beer (Beer!)
Beer (Beer!)
Beer (Beer!) Beer (Beer!)

When it's warm, it tastes real crappy
But cold beer will make me happy
When I throw up on the floor
I can go and drink some more
They say beer will make me dumb
It are go good with pizza
Now that we have drunk some beer
Let's go drive a car

Beer is good
Beer is good
Beer is good
And stuff
Beer is good
Beer is good
Beer is good
(Let's go drink some) Beer (beer!)
Beer (Beer!)
Beer (Beer!)
Beer (Beer!)
Beer (Beer!) Beer (Beer!)

Uh, dude? I think you've had enough
No!

Let's go drink some beer

I am drunk, drunk is me, I am drunk... wheee
I am drunk, drunk is me, I am drunk... wheee
I am drunk, drunk is me, I am...*burp*
