She called me late last night to say she loved me so
It didn't matter anymore
I say she never cared and that she never will
I'd do it all again, I guess I'll have to wait until then

And if I get drunk well I'll pass out on the floor now baby
'Cause you won't bother me no more

And if you're drinkin' well you know that you're my friend and I'll say
"I think I'll have myself a beer"

She called me late last night to say she loved me so
But I guess you changed her mind
Well, I should have known it wouldn't be all right
But I can't live without her so I won't even try

And if I get drunk well I'll pass out on the floor now baby
'Cause you won't bother me no more

And if you're drinkin' well you know that you're my friend and I'll say
"I think I'll have myself a beer"

Maybe some day I'll think of what to say
Maybe next time I'll remember what to do?
She looks like Heaven, maybe this is Hell?
She said she'd do it all again, she'd promise not to tell, (no!)

And if I get drunk well I'll pass out on the floor now baby
'Cause you won't bother me no more
(She said)
"It's okay boy, 'cause you know we'll be good friends" and I'll say
"I think I'll have myself a beer"
"I think I'll have myself a ..."

Whoo-oh-ho-whoo
Whoo-oh-ho-whoo
Whoo-oh-ho-whoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
