The Battleground Brewers Guild (BBG) is Greensboro North Carolina's premier homebrew club. We enjoy gathering at a brewery, pub, or home, to discourse about anything, but mostly sampling and discussing beer. We exchange ideas on brewing and brewing equipment in hopes of advancing our skills as brewers.

We meet monthly on the 3rd Monday at 7:00 PM at [Forgotten Road Ales GSO](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Forgotten+Road+Ales+GSO+303K+Pisgah+Church+Rd+Greensboro,+NC+27455/@36.1313779,-79.7945374,11z/data=!4m5!4m4!1m0!1m2!1m1!1s0x88531f481eaafbdf:0x1be5c2ab7ee7d59c){:.inline-link}.

Club dues are $35/yearly and can be collected at meetings or paid [here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=T58TEXSXGP2TU){:.inline-link} through PayPal.

The monthly meetings cover topics such as: making and judging beer styles, ingredient use, brewing methods, yeast preparation, and troubleshooting beer flavors. Members are encouraged to bring beer to share with the other members and get feedback (if desired). Our club calendar will reflect other meetings and events.
